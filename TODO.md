# Implementation Plan for Enhanced Image Processing

## 1. New Components to Create
- `ImageBatchUploader`: A drag-and-drop component for multiple image uploads
  - Will be used by both Gemini and IMGLY tabs
  - Shows preview thumbnails of uploaded images
  - Allows removing individual images
  - Shows progress/status for each image

- `ImageProcessingQueue`: Manages the processing queue for both services
  - Handles one image at a time
  - Shows progress for current image
  - Maintains batch session separation
  - Shows estimated time remaining

## 2. Common Actions Buttons for Gemini
- Quick action buttons for common operations:
  - Remove Background (most common)
  - Make Image More Professional
  - Change Style to Cartoon
  - Enhance Colors
  - Add White Background
  Each button will apply the same instruction to all queued images

## 3. Batch Processing Implementation
### Gemini Tab
1. Allow multiple image uploads via drag and drop
2. Queue management:
   - Store images in memory
   - Process one at a time
   - Show progress
   - Save results in session storage
3. Quick action buttons that apply to all queued images
4. Option to send processed images to IMGLY

### IMGLY Tab
1. Accept images from Gemini or direct upload
2. Process images one by one with progress indication
3. Optimize for white background removal
4. Save final results with transparent background

## 4. Session Management
- Clear all button to reset both tabs
- Separate storage for different processing batches
- Temporary storage for intermediate results

## 5. Inter-tab Communication
- Method to transfer processed images from Gemini to IMGLY
- Maintain image metadata and processing history
- Option to process all or selected images

## 6. User Interface Features
- Drag and drop zone for multiple files
- Progress indicators for both services
- Thumbnail previews of original and processed images
- Clear all button
- Transfer to IMGLY button in Gemini tab
- Batch status indicator

## 7. Error Handling
- Individual image processing errors
- Queue management errors
- Storage limits handling
- Invalid file types
- Network errors

## 8. Optimizations
- Image compression before processing
- Efficient memory management
- Cleanup of temporary storage
- Cancellation of processing queue
